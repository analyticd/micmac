MICMAC

Common Lisp implementation of Metropolis-Hastings and UCT by Gabor
Melis.

Although for now, Micmac has only a generic UCT, Metropolis-Hastings
MCMC and Metropolis Coupled MCMC method and it's kind of trivial, I
found it worthy of factoring out. Later more statistics related stuff
may be added.

It's under the MIT licence. See COPYING.

For an example on how to use it see test/test-*.lisp.

* Tests

Run the built in tests with:

  (ASDF:OOS 'ASDF:TEST-OP '#:MICMAC)
